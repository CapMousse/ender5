## Warped bed

It is common for printers of this price range to get a slightly warped bed. But it can be mitigated with some solutions, from easy and free to more complexe and expensive :

- [Manual Bed Mesh Leveling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcxM7-VK44k) with an upgraded firmware can help you map the bed and prevent bad first layer.
- A glass bed can completely flatten the bed and add a beautifull first layer to any prints.
- [Installing a BL Touch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp3D_1vJpvM) to automatically map the bed before printing.
